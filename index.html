                    using JavaScript I applied the fourier Transform onto a sequence of points which let me draw a series of rotating epicycles.

                      Using cellular automata and JavaScript, I created a randomly generated simulation of the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction.
                      With object oriented programming, each cell was able to have it's own output which changes every generation.
                      <br>
                      the simulation is based off of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpyKSRo8Iec">Belousov Zhabotinsky</a>

                    <td><h3>Chess AI</h3>
                      It was difficult to come up with an evaluation function for the min-max algorithm. For this AI, the eval function is purely based off of positional advantage with certain pieces being valued more at certain spots. Positional advantage also changes depending on what stage of the game we're on (calcualted by number of pieces on the board).

                      Using python and alpha-beta pruning, I was able to make this bot significantly faster. It's chess ELO is estimated between 1300-1500 on chess.com.

                      Google Colab Notebook is buggy, so you might need to stop/start the last code-block a couple of times until an input box shows.
